He says if 20% of the NHS workforce is being discriminated against, we all pay the price #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1348953241204236290,2021-01-12 11:21:29,6,5,"Covid-19 has been ‚Äòterrifying‚Äô for Black staff in the NHS says @Voa1234. Covid-19 is having a disproportionate impact on BAME communities. Anecdotal evidence is that Black staff continue to feel pushed into the frontline, unable to get the protection and support necessary."
1348951283391197184,2021-01-12 11:13:42,4,0,".@triciaapc says staff from BAME backgrounds in social care may be prevented from speaking out as they don‚Äôt want to be labelled as challenging and difficult, feel that career opportunities may be limited, or may fear losing shifts in roles with lower pay than their NHS peers."
1348950105093775360,2021-01-12 11:09:01,6,3,".@Voa1234 notes that most leaders leading the initial response to the covid-19 crisis were white. He asks: without NHS leaders from BAME backgrounds at the top of the tree, how are we going to understand the experiences of those at the bottom? #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1348948752279756803,2021-01-12 11:03:39,4,0,".@triciaapc says the issues discussed so far this morning echo those of social care, but social care is often seen as an afterthought. In a fragmented system, data is harder to capture. We need research and engagement with the workforce to capture their experience"

While things have improved, we have a long way to go ‚Äì the NHS is on the brink and we can't afford to have 20% of staff feeling disengaged"
1348944846636146689,2021-01-12 10:48:08,7,4,Helen√© Donnelly OBE says we need to make better use of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. @NatGuardianFTSU calls for triangulation of data locally along with a change in focus nationally so that culture is put on a par with finances and performance in the NHS #HSCCWorkforceBurnout

The question is the degree to which local leadership is trusted to get on with doing what they need to do. In the past people have felt the approach was too prescriptive."
1348937912671469573,2021-01-12 10:20:35,8,5,"The NHS understands compassionate leadership is needed, says Helen√© Donnelly OBE, but when the pressure‚Äôs on that goes out the window. NHS leaders who deliver with compassion and care are seen as not robust, as lightweight, but they are the right role models #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1348935455803400192,2021-01-12 10:10:49,3,0,.@NatGuardianFTSU says speaking up is only effective if leaders listen and act ‚Äì all leaders should see this as a key part of their role.

1348928157466976259,2021-01-12 09:41:49,5,2,"For the last ten years capacity has not matched demand in the NHS, says @ChrisCEOHopson, so we've asked staff to work harder and harder and harder. A fully costed long term properly funded plan on workforce numbers is absolutely essential."

1331183498368065536,2020-11-24 10:30:52,70,16,"@devisridhar says she doesn't believe the current restrictions were inevitable - she says over the summer cases were very low, if restrictions had been extended just a few more weeks and border controls maintained, this might have kept prevalence low"
1331183044292730880,2020-11-24 10:29:04,170,65,"On Christmas, @devisridhar says the issue is that people want to hear reassuring messages, but the virus doesn't care that it's Christmas - mixing indoors, with alcohol, and with elderly relatives, is very risky #COVID19LessonsLearnt"
1331182449993322496,2020-11-24 10:26:42,251,71,"@devisridhar says the consensus is that the UK locked down too late, and believes this was based on a false dichotomy between health and the economy - countries that chose to suppress community transmission with early, strict measures have had stronger economic recoveries"
1331182036757983232,2020-11-24 10:25:04,53,16,@devisridhar says it feels like the UK was too late in using border measures and travel restrictions to catch cases on entry; that testing is improving but low compliance with isolation undermines it; and communications with the public have not been clear enough

Thank you to all our witnesses. Watch the recording at https://t.co/SbhbLlL0bC 

üìó Look out for the transcript."
1328662354607935489,2020-11-17 11:32:45,20,10,"It's not OK that we don't have a detailed plan for those 1.6 million people working in social care, @vicrayner tells us. We need a fundamental commitment to protect and support them. We have to have that People Plan and resource it properly."
1328660977882198016,2020-11-17 11:27:17,7,0,@DrAdrianJames says the People Plan is amazing but a lot of staff will look at it and think 'we just don't have time for all that.' The wellbeing offer can often be lost. Wellbeing is about how are staff feeling about themselves so they can provide the best possible care.
1328659548434010114,2020-11-17 11:21:36,4,1,"NHS and social care organisations should take a scorecard approach to mental health says @paulfarmermind, looking at negative indicators - such as mental health sickness absence, and positive indicators - such as how many people in staff surveys feel in control of their workload."
1328657097546936320,2020-11-17 11:11:51,9,7,"Some social care employers are taking the lead, e.g. with mental health first aid training. But there is no clear understanding of what occupational health should be provided across organisations, says @VicRayner. All staff should have access to what is currently 'best practice.'"
1328656088703660034,2020-11-17 11:07:51,6,5,@vicrayner describes the heightened fear facing care staff that they might pass COVID-19 to vulnerable people they care for outside of work. Sickness days have risen from 2.9% last year to 7.5% this year which has put huge pressure on social care staff.
1328655106796105733,2020-11-17 11:03:57,6,3,"We went into this pandemic with high levels of stress in social care, @vicrayner tells the Committee. There was huge pressure on staff in care homes, giving end of life care without being able to share that burden with families, and no time to grieve the patients they lost."
1328653932277665792,2020-11-17 10:59:17,2,1,"Many NHS and social care staff have extraordinary levels of resilience, says @paulfarmermind, but everyone has their limit. Supervisors need to be aware of the signs of stress. It would be great if some services offered through the NHS were also offered to families of NHS staff."
1328652524665106432,2020-11-17 10:53:41,1,0,"You need to tackle the stigma within organisations and have a clear offer that every member of staff is aware of for those who are struggling, @paulfarmermind adds"
1328652368876101633,2020-11-17 10:53:04,7,4,Covid has provided the most enormous wake up call for the NHS about the fundamental need to look after your staff says @paulfarmermind #HSCCWorkforceBurnout
1328651076778692608,2020-11-17 10:47:56,3,1,"At the beginning of the pandemic, the challenging task at hand was energising: the level of innovation, the positive public response and remote working have all been positive things, says @DrAdrianJames #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1328649951040184325,2020-11-17 10:43:28,6,2,"Workforce burnout should be seen as primarily a patient safety issue, says @DrAdrianJames. During a pandemic, we can't do much about the primary stressors - e.g. volume of work. But we can do something about the secondary factors, such as having enough staff."
1328649079040188418,2020-11-17 10:40:00,6,3,"The two most important solutions to workforce burnout are reducing workload intensity and providing space for front facing staff to talk about the difficult issues they are facing, says @ClareGerada #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1328648075557146624,2020-11-17 10:36:00,0,0,"Doctors tend to have fewer risk factors for mental illness than the general population, @ClareGerada tells us, but are being put into impossible situations. We are seeing the trauma of COVID exposing previous trauma #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"

1328639894995030016,2020-11-17 10:03:30,8,10,"Seeing so much illness and death during the pandemic is something no doctor or nurse was prepared for, says @CNagpaul. Doctors told @TheBMA about the emotional impact of holding a smartphone so dying people could communicate with relatives, or treating their own colleagues."
1328637117770108930,2020-11-17 09:52:28,12,9,"Even before the pandemic 80% of doctors reported being at very high risk of burnout, with 40% reporting anxiety, depression or burnout, says @CNagpaul #HSCCWorkforceBurnout"
1328636446056517632,2020-11-17 09:49:48,5,2,"Discussing staffing in cancer services, Denise Crouch @Mac_Campaigning says the one in two people who will get cancer are going to need more support. She says we need the staff to be able to deal with patients, and late referrals are going to need more input."
1328634862782263296,2020-11-17 09:43:30,3,1,"During the first wave of COVID-19 it felt like 'Groundhog Day every day', says Denise Crouch @Mac_Campaigning. She was shattered but says she also felt privileged to contribute."

1326111445029883907,2020-11-10 10:36:21,3,0,"Prof Dr Gerard Krause says local health departments are responsible for compensating people asked to self-isolated, but this hasn't been claimed often because of wider aspects of employment support such as 'short work' where the Government tops up part time salaries to full time"
1326110213049634822,2020-11-10 10:31:27,5,0,"Prof Dr Gerard Krause also adds that contact tracing in Germany has been core part of the strategy from the outset and throughout - and has been the responsibility of local public health departments. Despite decades of underfinancing and understaffing, they have done a good job"
1326109613108973569,2020-11-10 10:29:04,5,0,He says running a PCR test is not magic - and in Germany there was never a notion that one centralised lab would claim to be the only one to know how to run COVID tests. He adds that there were financial incentives for smaller labs to run COVID tests #COVID19LessonsLearnt
1326109017031266305,2020-11-10 10:26:42,8,1,Professor Dr Gerard Krause @Helmholtz_HZI says it may be too early to judge why - and whether - Germany has performed better during the pandemic. But he says that German healthcare is very de-centralised which enabled testing capacity to be upscaled very quickly
1326107886561480704,2020-11-10 10:22:12,3,0,Professor Sir John Bell says that rapid testing can support contact tracing and isolation - isolating contacts is not very effective but is difficult for people asked to isolate. Rapid tests could be used to test contacts of positive cases to release them from isolation
1326106524792524800,2020-11-10 10:16:48,13,2,"@JoMartin_path is asked about how to use new lab capacity in the future - she says this won't be our last pandemic, so we will always need stand-up capacity for major incidents and major disease outbreaks.

1303287772917235712,2020-09-08 11:03:13,0,0,"Asked about local lockdowns, @MattHancock says that support for people to self-isolate in lockdown areas has been put in place, and contact tracing works seamlessly across national and local teams."

The next line of defence is testing and tracing which is radically stronger than in March. Local action is the third line of defence.
1303275639525568514,2020-09-08 10:15:00,0,1,"Asked about delays to bringing forward social care reform, @MattHancock says the Government made clear manifesto commitments on social care, but obviously coronavirus has delayed longer-term reform.

1303274326423199744,2020-09-08 10:09:47,1,2,@MattHancock says that the health and care visa will extend to people with a registered qualification working in social care. He says he does not think the Immigration Bill will undermine parity between NHS and social care professionals.

1285531481520197637,2020-07-21 11:06:03,13,8,"On care home deaths, @CMO_England says his enthusiasm for blaming people is zero. He says every country with a care sector has not handled this well.

1285519774911467520,2020-07-21 10:19:32,11,5,"@CMO_England says SAGE was consistent in saying we needed considerably more testing capacity, but test, trace and isolate requires more than just testing capacity and we did not have the infrastructure - you cannot suddenly switch these things on"
1285518905033793537,2020-07-21 10:16:05,10,3,"@CMO_England says that other countries put more emphasis on the case isolation. That was possible for the UK to do in the early stages, but not later on. When the wave came from Europe we did not have capacity for the scale of testing, case finding and isolation needed."
1285517957301444615,2020-07-21 10:12:19,37,27,"@CMO_England agrees with previous witnesses that the UK under-invested in public health - he says that every time there's a crisis, we say that more investment is needed, and then memory fades. There is a continued issue of investment."

The vaccine is unlikely to have a durable effect so we will have a continual cycle of vaccinations and more disease. The idea that we will eliminate coronavirus completely is unrealistic"

1285510662215602177,2020-07-21 09:43:20,24,11,"On care homes, @devisridhar says to protect the social care sector we have to keep transmission low, rigorously test and screen, and make clear decision-making structures and policies. What has happened in care homes is a tragedy."
1285510491696173058,2020-07-21 09:42:39,10,10,"@JeremyFarrar says there is no doubt that overweight and obesity is a risk factor for more severe Covid-19 outcomes, and that it is a clear risk factor for other conditions, and that Government policy to encourage more healthy lifestyles is important"
1285509692643565568,2020-07-21 09:39:28,357,109,"@devisridhar says if you want to reassure people, you have to provide them with accurate data and explain it. The way to get trust is not just to tell people they will be safe, but to show them data. Not having any data is as bad a problem as publishing data that needs explaining"
1285508042675585024,2020-07-21 09:32:55,19,8,"There is definitely a lack of diversity in SAGE, and I don't think it's a good decision making forum, says Professor Sir Paul Nurse. In dealing with crises of this sort we need a multidisciplinary approach, and we need to be better practised at working together"
1285507457918341120,2020-07-21 09:30:36,36,17,"Professor Sir Paul Nurse outlines what we need to put in place before the autumn:
- Clear leadership ""without people passing the buck""
- Communication and maintaining trust
- Testing capacity - with a better locally-connected lab system, not just centralised lighthouse labs"
1285506667468197888,2020-07-21 09:27:27,12,8,"@JeremyFarrar says #shielding is particularly difficult and we should not underestimate the impact of isolation on the people asked to shield. There is no zero risk situation but with hand washing, face masks, physical distancing of one or two metres people can meet safely"
1285506090713702401,2020-07-21 09:25:10,25,31,"This infection is not going away and we will not be done by Christmas, says @JeremyFarrar - even with a vaccine or effective treatments, humanity will be living with this virus for decades to come and we need a consistent, long-term approach"
1285505601615925248,2020-07-21 09:23:13,20,19,"On communications, @JeremyFarrar says that consistent messaging, and trust in that messaging, is vital. The public have to trust the message and the messenger, and that message has to be consistent over time. He says this has been more consistent in Scotland"
1285504050746863623,2020-07-21 09:17:03,37,23,@devisridhar says the 13 March SAGE minutes suggest that full suppression was undesirable as it would risk a second peak. What that decision missed was that the science would deliver solutions later on - and that you can achieve national elimination with border control

1285498559039709189,2020-07-21 08:55:14,40,27,"It wasn't a novelty to think that we should test healthcare workers, we had already learnt that from other countries, says Sir John Bell - as time went on, there was a suspicion that NHS institutions were avoiding testing so they didn't lose their workforce. That is not ethical."
1285498135817658368,2020-07-21 08:53:33,33,27,"Professor Sir John Bell agrees: ""The failure to address healthcare testing was a major oversight, and one where I'm not entirely sure what the motives were... as the number of cases rose, NHS lab capacity was completely overwhelmed and PHE were totally out of their depth"""

1282990273711218689,2020-07-14 10:48:12,6,2,"The care market is like being in a shop with no prices. That makes it very hard as a provider to innovate, adds Sir Andrew Dilnot. The funding model creates unfairness and anxiety for individuals, but also makes it difficult for #socialcare providers and contributes to low wages."
1282989639716999168,2020-07-14 10:45:41,5,3,"¬£45,000 would be an appropriate level for a cap on #socialcare costs, and would cost the state ¬£3.1bn a year, says Sir Andrew Dilnot."
1282989309428211712,2020-07-14 10:44:22,2,3,"Free personal care would be a bit like saying let‚Äôs make GP services free, but leaving those who have cancer exposed to risk, says Sir Andrew. Those facing very substantial costs would still be very exposed. The people we want to help most are those who face the highest needs."
1282989055911788544,2020-07-14 10:43:22,3,0,"A cap on #socialcare costs protects those who are the unluckiest with the highest care needs, says Sir Andrew Dilnot. Beyond the level of the cap, the state steps in and is able to cover catastrophic costs. A cap takes away fear."
1282988756434391041,2020-07-14 10:42:10,3,3,"Sir Andrew Dilnot sets out that the first essential step is to put more money into the means-tested system. Then we need to reform the means-tested system, which currently leaves people facing a huge cliff edge."

This was one burden too far in light of the fact she had given up her job to care for him, which had an impact on her own financial future."
1282972699338264577,2020-07-14 09:38:22,6,4,"Deborah @wordswork describes being told her husband's dementia is not a 'primary health care need'. Information on funding is confusing, hard to find, and contradictory. It is impossible to plan ahead, costing many sleepless nights. Navigating the system adds to Deborah‚Äôs stress."
1282970335755694081,2020-07-14 09:28:59,3,3,"Kevin outlines the barriers that charging creates for disabled people. In his view, it cannot be acceptable in the 21st century that people are falling into debt to pay for the care they need."
1282969630454079490,2020-07-14 09:26:10,6,6,"Kevin Caulfield describes a demeaning #socialcare financial assessment process, when what people need is support, peace and tranquillity. Instead, navigating the system places burdens on you as an individual, and reinforces the feeling of being 'other', and a burden."
1282968066775748609,2020-07-14 09:19:58,1,1,"As Diana‚Äôs savings fell below the eligibility threshold, her sister and brother, both pensioners, were asked to pay top up fees.

Thank you to our first panel - Rob Martinez, @KatherineRCEM, Derek Alderson @RCSnews and @MickArmstrong61 who described the impact of #coronavirus on surgery, emergency departments and dentists https://t.co/gymB8qgZys"
1272832525682061314,2020-06-16 10:04:56,2,1,"I am supposed to be shielding, but the advice is totally impossible to follow and is utterly meaningless, causing an enormous amount of distress says @dalonic"

1272830863668109313,2020-06-16 09:58:20,0,3,What have we learnt from Covid? How are we now going to change the conversation? How can we improve the way that the NHS works? - Key questions being considered by @NHSConfed from workforce to mental health to regulation
1272830508452450309,2020-06-16 09:56:55,1,5,"We don't just want to return to the old ways of working - there's an opportunity to think about how we plan, how we commission, how we deliver care in new, more effective and more productive ways @LaylaMcCay @NHSConfed"
1272830046642802693,2020-06-16 09:55:05,5,2,"We have heard that trusts and CCGs are doing things in a few weeks that would otherwise have taken years to accomplish, says @LaylaMcCay @NHSConfed. Having now tried out digital and seeing that it works, it's really moved things forward."

1272826357337280512,2020-06-16 09:40:26,2,2,"On communication with patients, @CharlotteAugst thinks poor communication is the common thread through the patient stories we've heard - but this is not new in the NHS"

But we're seeing people presenting as intoxicated going back up - I want to see the person who is having a stroke or having a heart attack.
1272815191441444864,2020-06-16 08:56:04,6,4,The need to keep people safe has given us the opportunity to break down barriers. The demise of silo working has been one of the most positive things that has come out of this @KatherineRCEM
1272815120977211392,2020-06-16 08:55:47,9,3,"There must be no return to silo working, says @KatherineRCEM, and although training has suffered, we have managed to deliver a lot of teaching and training, embracing Zoom as a way of doing meetings. We can trust healthcare staff to do things from home."
1272814641983500289,2020-06-16 08:53:53,10,4,"If you have departments that are big enough, a workforce that is big enough, and are not overwhelmed by patients, then you can provide really effective care says @KatherineRCEM"

Technology is important to this, for example, we need to better track patients for example if they have followed the advice from 111"
1272813022189420544,2020-06-16 08:47:26,7,5,"@KatherineRCEM Workforce is a real concern - we want to retain people, we want to make it possible to retain them in the system. We have a real worry about very experienced people for whom the aftermath (of the pandemic) might be too much."

1272809253774991360,2020-06-16 08:32:28,13,4,"@MickArmstrong61 @TheBDA - we need the correct PPE consistently and widely available, but the protocols in place severely limit our capacity to treat patients - in our practice we'd normally offer 150 appointments a day, it's now 10-15"
1272808848110346241,2020-06-16 08:30:51,11,5,"The effect on oral health has been ""catastrophic"" says @MickArmstrong61 @TheBDA - 8 million courses of treatment have been cancelled nationally"

She suggests a better contact point for urgent care before ED"
1272806448238604288,2020-06-16 08:21:19,5,8,"The Government needs to commit to maintaining such sites, including the arrangements with the private sector which have been taken during the pandemic, says Derek Alderson @RCSnews"

1272805599210856448,2020-06-16 08:17:57,6,8,Derek Alderson @RCSnews says the big sadness is that Rob's story is not atypical - people waiting for joint replacements constitute one of the largest groups waiting unacceptably long times for their surgery - in April this year we saw 1 million fewer patients compared to 2019
1272804309856669698,2020-06-16 08:12:49,5,6,"Rob thanks @VersusArthritis for their support over the past 12 months - if you're affected by the issues he has raised you can call their helpline on 0800 5200 520 (Monday ‚Äì Friday, 9am ‚Äì 8pm)"

1270300904391159808,2020-06-09 10:25:11,7,4,On average local authorities pay about ¬£17 per hour for home care - the UK Homecare Association estimate that the actual cost of delivering that care is ¬£21 per hour - says @AnitaCTHF
1270300492527284224,2020-06-09 10:23:33,5,6,"The local authority tells me I can't use my personal care funding to assist me with any health needs like picking up prescriptions or going to the GP - which is silly because if I don't, it will increase my need for social care in the future - says @AnnaSeverwright"
1270299308496224256,2020-06-09 10:18:50,3,3,"@AnnaSeverwright describes the inequity she feels in that any inheritance from her family would be spent on social care, whereas other people her age who do not need social care would have the option of investing that money or using it for another purpose."
1270298782236884994,2020-06-09 10:16:45,1,0,"Purely hypothecated taxes give Government less flexibility; partially hypothecated taxes are another option, but there often a lack of transparency about how they are spent - @TheIFS suggests additional contributions from broad-based taxation would be more appropriate."
1270296331303731207,2020-06-09 10:07:01,2,2,"We need to recognise, accredit and develop the skills of those working in social care, as well as rewarding. Things like integrated training are likely more important than integrated budgets in terms of delivering care that feels integrated to those receiving it, says @AnitaCTHF"
1270295969364619268,2020-06-09 10:05:34,2,1,"On the question of how you raise additional funding, there is a question of whether this is through general taxation, or a more ringfenced 'national insurance' style contribution, says @AnitaCTHF"
1270295396112351234,2020-06-09 10:03:18,6,1,"The number of apprenticeships in social care fell by 50% last year - we need to make social care a career, consider whether it should be registered - the Gov't has committed to an NHS workforce strategy but there are no plans for a social care workforce strategy, says @AnitaCTHF"
1270294470454587397,2020-06-09 09:59:37,10,4,Both Houses of Parliament are holding a minute's silence in memory of George Floyd at 11am today. The committee joins this silence and is now suspended.
1270293164193124449,2020-06-09 09:54:25,3,3,"We have several issues to address with funding - access; quality; pay for the workforce; provider stability - says @AnitaCTHF - the way social care is funded is fundamentally unfair, and people face catastrophic care costs."
1270292633110425600,2020-06-09 09:52:19,9,6,"@TheIFS tell the committee: we have very little information on who receives social care, how it is paid for and what the outcomes of that are - that needs to change. @AnnaSeverwright says councils collect information on numbers, but not on the experiences behind those numbers."
1270292023820632077,2020-06-09 09:49:54,3,4,"We need increased funding to make this happen - but we need reform as well as funding. Because of the pressure to cut costs we have commodified social care, and contracting has been a race to the bottom says @AnitaCTHF"
1270291680680456193,2020-06-09 09:48:32,3,3,"There is a gap between the vision set out in the Care Act - which aimed to put people at the heart of decisions about their care, and asks people what support they need to live the lives they want to live - and the reality says @AnitaCTHF"
1270290870198296576,2020-06-09 09:45:18,5,2,"@AnitaCTHF tells the committee: you cannot have your cake and eat it - the costs we find ourselves facing are the consequences of success - longer life expectancy, increased female particpation in the labour market and other social changes."
1270290734567079937,2020-06-09 09:44:46,2,0,"@AnitaCTHF says that we spend just under 1.5% of GDP on social care. The ¬£12bn increase is a lot, but would only take us to 1.7% of GDP - way less than what Denmark spends, and only 0.2% of GDP increase."
1270290086320582656,2020-06-09 09:42:12,2,0,"@AnitaCTHF tells the committee that if we had kept at the access and quality of care provided in 2010, we'd be spending ¬£10bn more by 23/34, not ¬£3.9bn. Adding the living wage takes it to ¬£12bn."
1270289723597209600,2020-06-09 09:40:45,5,5,"Since 2015, the number of older people who need help has increased by 60,000, but the number of people who are getting help through the social care system has fallen by 40,000, says @AnitaCTHF - through funding constraints people who would need care are no longer getting it."
1270288556041347075,2020-06-09 09:36:07,4,2,"Regardless of whether you think the current funding levels deliver the sufficient quality and access to care, social care needs a further ¬£2bn per year by 2023/24 just to keep rise with population growth, says @AnitaCTHF"
1270288131795947520,2020-06-09 09:34:26,13,8,"If we believe that older people, disabled people, people with learning disabilities, should be able to live as full a life as other people, then we need to be providing the funding that enables them to do that, says @AnnaSeverwright"
1270287955744231425,2020-06-09 09:33:44,2,1,"I use direct payment to employ my own personal assistant carer, @AnnaSeverwright tells the committee - it means I get choice which is great, but the amount of money we get is very low, which means recruitment and retention of PAs is quite hard."
1270287565262897152,2020-06-09 09:32:11,5,3,"I feel sick when my funding review is due, as I fear that my funding will be cut - and I know many people who's funding has been cut by one third - that's a third less life they can live, says @AnnaSeverwright"
1270287397973102592,2020-06-09 09:31:31,2,1,"@AnnaSeverwright tells the committee: I often have to choose how I use my social care allocation - if I only have two hours left this week, do I want to have a shower, do I want to go to shopping, do I want to meet a friend?"
1270287208252084224,2020-06-09 09:30:45,9,4,"The structure and system for integrating health and social care doesn't matter to me as a social care user - what is important is that things are structured around me, as a person, to enable me to live the life I want to lead says @AnnaSeverwright"
1270286893251510274,2020-06-09 09:29:30,9,13,"We are now hearing from our second panel of witnesses - @AnnaSeverwright @TheIFS @AnitaCTHF for our hearing on Social care: funding and workforce.

1270285879458873344,2020-06-09 09:25:29,4,2,"In Denmark, both social care and health care assistants are working in hospitals and care settings, working across both sectors: training is a stepping stone, with progression from 'helpers' to 'assistants' and eventually becoming nurses if they wish, says Tine Rosgaard."
1270283089663741954,2020-06-09 09:14:23,1,2,"Wages have increased over the years, although they are not as high as other sectors, and the focus on reablement - work to improve older people's skills - is very rewarding for those working in social care, and leads to greater job satisfaction, says Tine Rosgaard."
1270282106552430592,2020-06-09 09:10:29,2,0,Tine Rosgaard tells the committee that having somebody in hospital who understands the social care system is essential to the discharge team as they can act as a broker between the two systems.
1270281539511779328,2020-06-09 09:08:14,3,2,"We have a cultural difference in Nordic countries in that we regard personal care as a state responsibility - this is part of the social contract, care for frail older people is the responsibility of the local authority, says Tine Rosgaard."
1270280429522898944,2020-06-09 09:03:49,3,3,"If you can organise integrated support for people either at home or in a care home, which will support them in event of a crisis, that will not only prevent an unnecessary admission, but be a much better experience for the person in question, says Paul Little."
1270279385820598274,2020-06-09 08:59:40,1,0,"We try as much as we can in Denmark to provide social care at home, says Tine Rosgaard, provided free of charge - there is no stigma associated with using this service. There is a choice between providers, and around 11% of older people use home care."
1270279285618679811,2020-06-09 08:59:16,1,0,"Tine Rosgaard says reducing the number of LAs in Denmark increased efficiency, enabling us to establish routines and systems that promote integration between health and social care. Health and social care education and training is combined, and we focus on prevention."
1270279111404072960,2020-06-09 08:58:35,0,0,"The discharge process which we now have in place involves hospital based multidisciplinary teams including both primary and secondary care and social care professionals, says Tine Rosgaard, and this has improved discharge planning."
1270277165028970497,2020-06-09 08:50:51,2,1,"Asked whether she herself got any support as a carer, @DaphneHavercro1 says that although she asked for a carers assessment it never happened - and they did not follow it up as her priority was on getting her mother's care sorted."
1270276410624675841,2020-06-09 08:47:51,4,0,"Supporting my mother through the interface between health and social care was the most difficult thing I've faced in my life, says @DaphneHavercro1 - GPs have a key role to play in co-ordinating this, but the value that they can add is not being properly used."
1270275577837162496,2020-06-09 08:44:32,2,1,@DaphneHavercro1 tells the committee: we found ourselves in what was really a dispute with the local authority about my mother's ability to make decisions and that seemed paralyse the care planning process - I was forced to write my own mother's care plan.
1270275341538299904,2020-06-09 08:43:36,3,0,"My mother needed to be listened to...she needed her family to be involved in planning the discharge...but it was almost like the health and social care professionals felt that they knew better, and we were side-lined, says @DaphneHavercro1"
1270275341395939329,2020-06-09 08:43:36,6,0,"My mother needed to be listened to...she needed her family to be involved in planning the discharge...but it was almost like the health and social care professionals felt that they knew better, and we were side-lined, says @DaphneHavercro1"
1270275011635548161,2020-06-09 08:42:17,7,1,"The priority of the hospital, community and social care teams was to spend as little money as possible on Dorothy, to keep her out of hospital, and to prevent inappropriate hospital admissions - it had the reverse effect, with three emergency admissions, says @DaphneHavercro1"
1270274459174416385,2020-06-09 08:40:06,6,2,"There was no integrated working between health and social care professionals to plan discharge, and there was no continuity between clinicians, @DaphneHavercro1 tells the committee."

1268204343968309259,2020-06-03 15:34:12,3,2,"At the beginning of this when we found ourselves desperately short of #PPE, we had 14,500 offers of support to provide supplies, says Lord Deighton. Sorting through these to identify how to fill gaps was a long and complicated process - we have something like 100 new suppliers"
1268201932012863488,2020-06-03 15:24:37,1,3,"My plan is to build in more resilience to our supply plan here in the UK, to avoid reliance on particular other countries such as China, says Lord Deighton"
1268200871269187588,2020-06-03 15:20:24,0,2,"We have now stabilised the #PPE situation to the degree that we are confident in our 7-day and 90-day horizon of supply and demand, says Lord Deighton, though there will be stresses from time to time https://t.co/YgbgwFkOZZ"
1268199809808293888,2020-06-03 15:16:11,1,1,The Committee is now moving on to question Lord Deighton about #PPE
1268199693999276032,2020-06-03 15:15:43,1,1,".@didoharding: Testing capacity is ample for today but as we look towards winter where people have more flu like symptoms it will be important for testing capacity to expand, speed up and improve reliability. I want us to be measuring all those three things, not just one of them."
1268198551198318595,2020-06-03 15:11:11,0,1,".@didoharding: This is a service that will encourage us all to be better at social distancing and good hand hygiene. Test and trace is not a silver bullet - if you have not been within 2m of someone outside your household for more than 15 minutes, you cannot be a close contact"
1268198160016515074,2020-06-03 15:09:37,0,1,Public Health England are responsible for holding the data for NHS Test &amp; Trace. @didoharding says the scheme is being carried out in compliance with GDPR. She confirms the data won't be shared with any other Government body.
1268196608203784193,2020-06-03 15:03:28,0,2,.@didoharding: I am not going to pretend that this is perfect... but there is a lot that we are doing that will enable us all to stay safer.
1268196322479349768,2020-06-03 15:02:19,1,1,"On concerns about fraud, @didoharding clarifies that NHS contact tracers will never ask for financial details and official phone numbers are listed on the https://t.co/vNHhjtIJ8V website. Anyone with concerns is advised to check the web URL they have been directed to carefully"
1268195436755587074,2020-06-03 14:58:48,0,2,.@didoharding: This is as much about local action as it is about national action. We all need to play our part - the Government is providing direct funding to local authorities for this https://t.co/ICuDB12KXJ
1268195003366625285,2020-06-03 14:57:05,0,2,".@didoharding: I see test and trace as a multi-channel service. You need the bedrock of the end to end tracking and tracing service, which is why we've launched the NHS track and tracing service first. The app isn't core of this - but it will speed things up"
1268191693456711680,2020-06-03 14:43:56,8,9,".@didoharding: There are approximately 8,000 people contracting COVID-19 every day. At the moment we are testing 1,600 per day. Some 44% of adults are not aware that anyone who has symptoms can order a test"
1268190846207373312,2020-06-03 14:40:34,0,0,"But, says @didoharding, the vast majority of people who are being asked to isolate are very happy to do so. We have contacted thousands of people in the first six days."
1268189941676335105,2020-06-03 14:36:58,1,5,"We are close to agreeing a weekly dashboard for test and trace data, but I don't have the data to share today, says @didoharding"
1268189213448601603,2020-06-03 14:34:04,2,3,"The Committee is now beginning its questioning of Baroness @didoharding, head of NHS track and trace"
1268189041188573184,2020-06-03 14:33:23,2,0,Turnaround time is very important says @ChristoPhraser - and the daily reporting of testing should also publish how long turnaround times are
1268187341321093120,2020-06-03 14:26:38,1,1,"About 55,000 people on the Isle of Wight are using the NHS contact tracing app says @ChristoPhraser, which is pretty good considering the age of residents and level of smartphone usage. The next phase is focusing on how to better integrate the app with testing"
1268186299317596162,2020-06-03 14:22:30,1,1,"On data gathered by the app, @ChristoPhraser says people must have trust in the system for an app to work. Sharing new types of data in the health system has led to substantial debate but research suggests most people support the use of the data for research in the NHS https://t.co/ChCw1guyvt"
1268183941204369409,2020-06-03 14:13:07,0,2,Singapore and Norway have achieved around 30% uptake for their apps but we need to build trust before these technologies can be proven on a national programme scale says @ChristoPhraser
1268183661259735040,2020-06-03 14:12:01,1,0,"For an app to be seen to be successful, it needs to be integrated and seen as part of a public health programme, says @ChristoPhraser, which will include manual contact tracing and social distancing."
1268182763158622208,2020-06-03 14:08:27,4,1,"You have four days from someone displaying #coronavirus symptoms to completing the test and trace process - and most people only come for a test after two days, meaning you really only have a two day window says @ChristoPhraser"
1268182251336056836,2020-06-03 14:06:25,2,1,We're now transitioning from a #StayAtHome  message to people coming forward and engaging with testing and tracing says @ChristoPhraser - it's fairly clear that countries which have managed to take that approach from the outset have fared better
1268181321744093186,2020-06-03 14:02:43,11,4,People in Taiwan know that good health behaviour is good for you and your friends - it's a win win says Sir Chen Chien-jen https://t.co/hb8jPoZFtZ
1268180211453038594,2020-06-03 13:58:18,5,1,Health education and risk communication is very important in Taiwan says Sir Chen Chien-jen. We have continuous education about maintaining good health behaviour from early years onwards
1268178950125244418,2020-06-03 13:53:17,7,3,"Taiwan amended its infection control laws in 2000 to enable contract tracing to be delivered during an outbreak, as well as to protect confidentiality. When privacy and confidentiality can be guaranteed, people are more likely to comply"
1268177227834851330,2020-06-03 13:46:27,11,4,"The key element of success in Taiwan has been public trust in our public health policy and institutions, says Sir Chen Chien-jen, supported by effective and open communication enabling appropriate compliance"
1268176295990525952,2020-06-03 13:42:45,10,6,"In Taiwan #coronavirus tests report within 1 day from over 140 sites, and it takes between 1 and 3 days from a positive result to perform a full contact tracing"
1268175559152078854,2020-06-03 13:39:49,4,2,Taiwan requires all inbound passengers from other countries to self-quarantine for 14 days.

1262694211624873984,2020-05-19 10:38:54,5,4,"@JamesBullion refers to the need for a long-term social care plan to sit alongside the NHS long-term plan, the regulation of the social care market, and the urgency not just of giving local authorities the money they need to fund social care, but deciding how to pay for it."
1262690834828406784,2020-05-19 10:25:29,10,3,"@vicrayner emphasises the need for a national minimum dataset for social care. We can‚Äôt plan without that data, she argues - it saves lives."
1262690601713180672,2020-05-19 10:24:33,4,2,"The big lessons we need to learn are about the integration between health and social care, the need for a workforce plan aligned to an NHS workforce plan which allows people to move across systems, and the need for a long term funding solution, says @ProfMartinGreen"
1262690074216497152,2020-05-19 10:22:27,16,8,"Social care staff are going through a constant cycle of bereavement, losing people they are caring for to #Covid_19 , says @ProfMartinGreen . In hospitals there has been a focus on bereavement and trauma support and we need the same support for care home staff, adds @vicrayner"
1262688890659446784,2020-05-19 10:17:45,5,1,"@JamesBullion agrees: ‚ÄúWe have been sleepwalking without a workforce strategy for adult social care for five years now, with huge turnover rates and no career grade structure.‚Äù"
1262688502229196800,2020-05-19 10:16:13,2,0,"In the longer term we have got to completely redefine social care work, with proper alignment with the NHS, financing, training and qualifications, says @ProfMartinGreen"
1262688233756004353,2020-05-19 10:15:09,8,4,"We need to enable a care environment which is not just about safety and infection control, but about protecting people's quality of life as well, says @vicrayner . Our hugely skilled social care staff will play a vital role in this."
1262687381641138177,2020-05-19 10:11:46,6,2,"Responding to the argument from @ProfMartinGreen about localism, @JamesBullion argues that local govt has stood up well, and that national approaches to testing and #PPE have not worked. Localism has actually worked well in terms of delivering PPE and testing to local providers."
1262686628604260356,2020-05-19 10:08:46,2,3,"Care providers need the money to help them ensure the safety of their residents and staff, @JamesBullion tells the Committee. They have seen enormous increases in their #PPE costs. The funding allocated to local authorities is only a quarter of what is needed."
1262685371709751296,2020-05-19 10:03:46,1,1,"We need a national strategy, argues @ProfMartinGreen - what we've seen is that localism is not fit for purpose in a crisis. We need clear central direction from central Government."
1262684724243333120,2020-05-19 10:01:12,4,4,"There wasn't a recognition in the 2016 planning process or at the start of this pandemic that the most vulnerable people are in care homes, says @ProfMartinGreen . Pandemic planning did not comprehensively overview social care or understand that it was a very diverse system."
1262683937698127876,2020-05-19 09:58:04,4,5,"We had a policy of emptying hospitals and filling care homes, @ProfMartinGreen tells the Committee, whereas other countries have had a policy of taking people out of care homes, if there was difficulty in isolating them."
1262683340001476608,2020-05-19 09:55:42,12,5,"Social care staff are doing a remarkable job in incredibly difficult circumstances, says @vicrayner , and the last thing we want is for those people to feel like they are responsible for the spread of #Covid_19"
1262682632762114049,2020-05-19 09:52:53,4,3,"The Committee discusses the role of staff moving between #carehomes in spreading #Covid_19 . @AdelinaCoHe tells the Committee that in Canada, Israel and Singapore, staff have been prevented from working in multiple care homes."
1262681485280231425,2020-05-19 09:48:20,4,6,"For managing a second wave, it's absolutely critical that we have regular repeat testing, and that the results come through rapidly, argues @vicrayner . The 30,000 tests a day we have will enable us to test everyone in care homes, but only once - not repeatedly."
1262680376713109504,2020-05-19 09:43:55,6,5,"We have seen about 10% of people stopping their personal assistant care and #homecare to try to protect themselves from infection - but this can have serious health risks and consequences in itself, adds @JamesBullion"
1262680078531596289,2020-05-19 09:42:44,7,5,"When we look at the figures, both the deaths and figures for transmission suggest we have difficulties in #homecare, says @JamesBullion . The response in this area has been totally inadequate so far and we need a separate plan for the domiciliary care sector."
1262679387507433472,2020-05-19 09:40:00,4,4,"We still don‚Äôt have an effective supply chain for #PPE, says @JamesBullion . If we had had a national planning on PPE we'd be far ahead of where we are now - some of the problems we are seeing in transmission are a result of this, and, sadly, some of the deaths too."
1262678856902811649,2020-05-19 09:37:53,5,4,"An international partnership approach is needed, says @vicrayner . We have lots of examples where homes have remodelled for social distancing but they have not been picked up nationally. Most of our stock is old and set up for people to come together and share space."
1262678177387773953,2020-05-19 09:35:11,4,3,"We should have been focusing on care homes from the start of the pandemic, says @ProfMartinGreen - the focus on the NHS often meant that care homes lost out on medical support and PPE."
1262677830137151488,2020-05-19 09:33:48,0,4,"We've had the announcements, @ProfMartinGreen tells the Committee, but there's been a time delay- we haven't had the delivery. We need testing and track-and-trace together to be able to make a difference."
1262677324429918208,2020-05-19 09:31:48,1,3,"Testing is crucial, argues @ProfMartinGreen . Testing is improving, but there are logistical issues and significant time delays - of up to 8-10 days. We need regular testing, 2-3 times a week, if we are to really get on top of this."
1262676762774863872,2020-05-19 09:29:34,0,0,"We are at the top of curve and heading downwards now, in terms of the #carehome home epidemic, says @ProfMartinGreen"
1262676412210851842,2020-05-19 09:28:10,11,15,"We are now hearing form the second panel of witnesses - @AdelinaCoHe @ProfMartinGreen @JamesBullion and @vicrayner , for our session on the management of the #coronavius outbreak.

1262673909268217856,2020-05-19 09:18:13,1,1,"We know that if you get infected with #COVID„Éº19 it's not just you but the whole family and the extended family, says @TerryLum . In Hong Kong scientific experts have given information in a way that everyone can understand."
1262673374364516354,2020-05-19 09:16:06,1,1,"‚Ä¶ In nursing homes, there is a designated area for visitors, but there is a strict protocol for visitors entering nursing homes including temperature checks, hand sanitiser and face masks."
1262673214783868929,2020-05-19 09:15:28,1,1,"It is very hard to stop the virus spreading in care homes once it is there, so preventative measures to keep the virus out of #carehomes are critical, according to Isabell Halletz @AGVpflege ‚Ä¶"
1262671884870713345,2020-05-19 09:10:11,1,3,"Isabell Halletz @AGVpflege tells the Committee that #carehomes in Germany would not take patients from hospitals unless they had the ability to isolate them for two weeks, following experience of asymptomatic patients bringing the disease into care homes."
1262671282300243970,2020-05-19 09:07:47,1,1,"Each #carehome must now start to have good technical support on their isolation capabilities and we need to improve the connection with local information about disease spread, warns @AdelinaCoHe"
1262670494358220801,2020-05-19 09:04:39,1,2,"Germany was very strict with the lockdown, including in #carehomes, where only those directly providing care were allowed in, says Isabell Halletz @AGVpflege . In long term care homes there was a requirement to wear full protective equipment at the end of March."
1262669964340867078,2020-05-19 09:02:33,1,2,"In HK everyone has a high sense of vulnerability after SARS, so early on people started taking action such as wearing face masks, @TerryLum continues. All staff in nursing homes were required to wear masks from late Jan, and from early Feb, visits to care homes were stopped."
1262669406464860160,2020-05-19 09:00:20,3,2,"People have a very strong sense of responsibility in Hong Kong and acted quickly in response to the emerging pandemic, says @TerryLum . The infection control process was started in mid January, before we had a single case."
1262668894579437568,2020-05-19 08:58:18,2,2,"Thirdly is co-ordination, Isabell Halletz @AGVpflege  continues. After SARs, we realised that care homes lacked a co-ordinator to manage infection control. Now all care homes have a single point of contact who manages infection control and plays a crucial role."
1262668470375854081,2020-05-19 08:56:37,2,1,"Stopping the transmission from hospitals to #carehomes is the most important factor, Isabell Halletz @AGVpflege argues. Secondly we do a very good job of isolation, not just of the infected person but also of their contacts, who are tested repeatedly for a 14 day period."
1262667376996372480,2020-05-19 08:52:16,6,2,"Hospital discharge is a very big risk for #carehome residents, according to Isabell Halletz. In Germany, patients have to provide a negative test result, or they are quarantined for 14 days in a separate section of the care home or a separate 'stop over' quarantine facility."
1262666656574320640,2020-05-19 08:49:24,6,4,"Not a single person has died of #Covid-19 in a South Korean #carehome, @AdelinaCoHe tells the Committee. Anyone with suspected COVID was removed from care homes and placed in isolation either in hospital or a quarantine place. Singapore responded similarly swiftly."
1262665387130445830,2020-05-19 08:44:22,6,3,"We need very good awareness of local infection rates, and then testing for all #carehome residents and staff, including contact tracing, and isolation, @AdelinaCoHe says."
1262664755485069314,2020-05-19 08:41:51,4,7,"Being realistic about the ability of #carehomes to be isolation centres is key, and we need to be reasonable about what we are expecting them to do, @AdelinaCoHe continues."
1262663847279759362,2020-05-19 08:38:15,5,5,"Having large numbers of deaths in care homes is not inevitable, argues @AdelinaCoHe . Community control is essential - if you don't have COVID in the community, you don't have it in care homes."

1260956068651446272,2020-05-14 15:32:08,4,3,"Asked by Committee member @drlukeevans what has surprised him the most about the response to #Covid, @RichardDMurray1 asks how we were so slow when we saw what had happened in Europe."
1260954142945824770,2020-05-14 15:24:29,2,2,"We have effectively shrunk our bed numbers too low and very large numbers of hospitals have insufficient capacity in their emergency departments, says @ChrisCEOHopson , so we need a serious capital investment as we move forward."
1260953786673238017,2020-05-14 15:23:04,1,2,"Capital investment has been slow, argues @JenniferTHF : it has kept the service ticking over but not enough to modernise. We need to think about having reserve capacity in the system, and take a longer look at how technology has a long-term therapeutic effect on patients."
1260950760382181381,2020-05-14 15:11:03,2,3,"@JenniferTHF , @RichardDMurray1  and @nedwards_1 all agree that it is too soon to bring in legislative changes. The pandemic has shown that organisations are already able to collaborate when they need to. Providing answers on social care should be the priority."
1260949438836637697,2020-05-14 15:05:48,0,2,"Asked about the proposed #NHS Bill, @ChrisCEOHopson argues that we probably don't have the national architecture right--as we have seen with testing. We need to be careful about having management and accountability too far away from frontline care, he says."
1260946724207673351,2020-05-14 14:55:00,3,0,@RichardDMurray1 tells the Committee there are a whole range of steps that can be taken to ensure that the leadership of organisations respects the diversity of their staff. #Covid should make us even more determined to overcome longstanding inequalities.
1260945861116387329,2020-05-14 14:51:35,10,8,"What #Covid has done has exacerbated known #inequalities in the population, argues @JenniferTHF, and now is the time for an equalities strategy."
1260945025980121088,2020-05-14 14:48:16,2,0,"The scientific consensus on why #BAME staff and citizens are more at risk from #Covid is not clear, but they certainly appear to be and this means we must increase the use of #PPE and other measures to keep this group safe, says @RichardDMurray1"
1260943639578136577,2020-05-14 14:42:45,2,1,"One of the consistent issues that has been raised with our CEOs is that #PPE appears not to fit particular groups, such as BAME staff; CEOs are trying to source the right type of masks, and where that's not possible they have been considering redeployment, says @ChrisCEOHopson"
1260942914336821251,2020-05-14 14:39:52,4,1,"‚Ä¶and if there is one thing that #Covid has taught us, it's that the social care workforce needs to be considered along with the health service."

1260941712777674752,2020-05-14 14:35:06,0,4,@ChrisCEOHopson says at the moment Trusts cannot guarantee sufficient reliable and consistent access to tests for #NHS staff in a timely way. There are still significant problems with laboratory capacity and access to reagents and chemicals.
1260940216916992001,2020-05-14 14:29:09,3,3,"At the moment the assistance for the #voluntarysector has simply not been enough, @JenniferTHF tells the Committee, and this is affecting what they can do to help the health service."
1260939277892038657,2020-05-14 14:25:25,2,2,@nedwards_1  expresses concern that #dentists haven‚Äôt been given any instructions about how to safely run a dental practice. There is no sign of them opening as we don't really know what prevention and infection control measures that we will need.

1260935819306635265,2020-05-14 14:11:41,2,4,"Staff are working under constraints they have simply never seen before and are therefore exhausted, which is concerning our trust leaders as we look to ramp up services, says @ChrisCEOHopson .     .."

1260933849699115008,2020-05-14 14:03:51,6,8,"NHS staff have worked incredibly hard and done exceptional things, including cancelling leave, and are very tired, says @ChrisCEOHopson--they need a break.

1260932273001512967,2020-05-14 13:57:35,3,6,"Most A&amp;E depts do not have the physical capacity to do social distancing, says @nedwards_1. He advises following the Norway and Denmark model, where individuals only use A&amp;E after referrals--otherwise we will need a lot of additional space that needs to be staffed."
1260931159539634181,2020-05-14 13:53:10,1,4,"Trusts are telling us that this next phase is going to be more difficult than the phase we've just gone through, says @ChrisCEOHopson, not least because of the challenges posed by social distancing."
1260930185789992960,2020-05-14 13:49:17,3,4,"The key to avoiding a spike in cancer mortality is just how quickly cancer referrals pick up again, @RichardDMurray1  tells the Committee. Referrals have dropped sharply, but are now rising again, and have doubled, back up to 20,000 per week."
1260929542186627074,2020-05-14 13:46:44,4,4,"It is going to be very difficult to go back to what we had in A+E before the #COVID crisis, warns @nedwards_1.

1257619676936503296,2020-05-05 10:34:31,1,4,"Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, is unable to give us an answer as to how many tests are needed. She explains that this depends on a variety of changing factors such as local circumstances, but the 100,000 puts us in a very good place #Coronavirus"
1257619372958535681,2020-05-05 10:33:18,3,5,She clarifies that the scientific advice on large gatherings would have come from SAGE but the decision on individual cases would not be something for the scientific committee  or the Chief Medical Officer to take - it was an individual decision for the Government
1257619036361437184,2020-05-05 10:31:58,4,7,"Dr Jenny Harries: it's not possible to say whether Liverpool-Athletico Madrid match seeded further cases in the North West, it is possible that there were already other community cases at that point. The decision about whether a match would go ahead is not one for the CMO or SAGE"
1257616298432962560,2020-05-05 10:21:05,5,5,"On whether international travel should have been suspended earlier, Dr Jenny Harries says that the risks as well as benefits need to be considered. Sir Patrick adds: that stopping travel from a single place will not work, you have to be draconian and stop travelling everywhere"
1257615573225177089,2020-05-05 10:18:12,2,0,"Dr Jenny Harries adds: The plan as it stood was sensible, logical and based on good traditional public health practice. However we perhaps didn't think through the digital progression and opportunity. We have moved very swiftly on establishing research more coherently and rapidly"
1257615497337724928,2020-05-05 10:17:54,2,1,"Sir Patrick says: his and his colleagues' judgements based on scientific information, not scientific certainties."
1257615101026279425,2020-05-05 10:16:20,11,13,"When asked ""what would you have done differently?"" Sir Patrick says that ""probably in the early phases, if we had managed to ramp up testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial...testing is not the answer, it's part of the system you have to get right"""
1257614432923942912,2020-05-05 10:13:40,2,3,"Sir Patrick confirms in answering the Committee's questions that ""there is a lot of work going on right now which is looking at how measures to lift lock-downs are working in other countries"""
1257614150198591488,2020-05-05 10:12:33,1,4,@uksciencechief  continues: The plan now is to get the number of new cases back down to a manageable number as part of a system that can pick up small local outbreaks early. #coronavirus
1257613982787080193,2020-05-05 10:11:53,6,9,"Sir Patrick adds: at the early stages, it absolutely was about trying to contain, isolate and track every case in the UK which were imported from the original outbreak in China. Then it became clear that we were having a massive influx of cases from multiple European sources"
1257612846952845314,2020-05-05 10:07:22,10,13,"Sir Patrick Vallance @uksciencechief says that ""right from the very first meeting on the pandemic, on 22 January 2020, we raised the issue of testing and tracking, and continually thereafter"""
1257612467812827137,2020-05-05 10:05:52,1,3,"On of preventing #covid cases increasing exponentially, Dr Harries says: we are at a different point on the epidemic curve. Social distancing measures have pushed the rate down and removed a lot of transmission in the population. We should be able to identify &amp; control new cases"
1257611404091277312,2020-05-05 10:01:38,4,3,"When asked what is the number of new cases we need to reach in order for contact tracing to work, Dr Harries says: if the R number is and stays down, and we have tested methods of doing this - as are currently being trialled in the Isle of Wight - then we can move to this soon"
1257610680531914752,2020-05-05 09:58:46,11,5,"Dr Jenny Harries says that why we are seeing more coronavirus-related deaths in BAME communities is unclear:  once higher levels of chronic disease amongst BAME individuals are taken into account, as well as socio-economic conditions, it becomes a very complex picture."

1257606817611493382,2020-05-05 09:43:25,8,10,"Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy CMO, tells us that the broad number of tests that haven taken place in Germany is the similar to the number of tests carried out in Italy - testing per se is not enough, it is the follow up afterwards. Watch our session live here: https://t.co/KwPL2Fko0j"
1257606403226832896,2020-05-05 09:41:46,1,3,"She adds: In South Korea they had more focused outbreaks where contact tracing could be done more easily than in countries with widespread community transmission....The ""Test Test Test"" mantra from the World Health Organisation came at a time when many countries were not testing"
1257606150343835648,2020-05-05 09:40:46,3,9,Dr Jenny Harries: if the UK had unending capacity to test and pursue contact tracing then it might have been appropriate to continue with this in the UK.
1257604054286557184,2020-05-05 09:32:26,1,3,"Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, tell us that we will have to wait until the end of the pandemic to do robust comparisons between countries' death rates, and even then it will be very difficult because different countries collect data in very different ways"
1257603268248850432,2020-05-05 09:29:18,3,5,He says: very young children tend to have less contact outside their own households compared to older children so they may be less likely to promote onward transmission between households #coronavirus
1257602473625354240,2020-05-05 09:26:09,3,8,"On the topic of transmission amongst children, Sir Patrick adds: the evidence is that children are unlikely to be higher than adults in terms of transmission of coronavirus and may in fact be lower, but the evidence is not yet compelling"
1257602226895364096,2020-05-05 09:25:10,1,6,"@uksciencechief says it is very clear that children are at much lower risk of clinical disease and severe disease - this is not zero risk, but very much reduced. There is also reasonable evidence to suggest that they are at lower risk of getting symptomatic disease."
1257601626396930054,2020-05-05 09:22:47,2,3,"He adds: There are pros and cons of releasing measures on a local level rather than a national one but it is an option, although there are issues around transport if you do that."
1257601511393288192,2020-05-05 09:22:20,4,8,"Sir Patrick says: the ""R"" varies slightly across the country but there isn't huge variation - it might be 0.6 in London and 0.7 elsewhere for example. Densely populated areas have higher prevalence than rural areas."
1257600839134466049,2020-05-05 09:19:39,1,4,"In presenting advice to Ministers, SAGE tries to focus on to two or three options, set out the reasons behind these options, but also  the relevant uncertainties - SAGE does not act in a ""here is the answer, get on with it"" way when advising the Government"
1257599720521969664,2020-05-05 09:15:13,3,9,"Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, tells us that for many elderly people in care homes there appears to be a different presentation of the disease, which has made its management more difficult #COVID„Éº19 https://t.co/L2ds9Ir8gp"
1257598563758026752,2020-05-05 09:10:37,3,8,"@uksciencechief says it is very hard to give an overall estimate of 'R' (rate of infection) in care homes as they are spread around the country but bringing this under control, as well as transmission in hospitals, is critical to the overall control of the epidemic #COVID„Éº19"
1257597444667424768,2020-05-05 09:06:10,7,11,"Sir Patrick says the rules are very clear: people should still be social distancing, washing their hands regularly and avoiding touching their faces. These are much more significant factors than face masks in reducing transmission #covid-19"
1257597079834296320,2020-05-05 09:04:43,0,4,He adds: SAGE's evidence suggests that there is a marginal but positive effect on preventing the spread of coronavirus in the community. SAGE's evidence suggests that there is a marginal but positive effect of wearing masks on preventing the spread of coronavirus in the community
1257596824464109568,2020-05-05 09:03:42,9,10,Sir Patrick Vallance @uksciencechief tells us that he thinks that the most highly infectious time is a day or two before symptoms starts and a day or two after symptoms start. This means asymptomatic transmission may be a cause of transmission.
1257596632402722821,2020-05-05 09:02:56,3,5,"When asked about the lack of economists working for SAGE, Sir Patrick says that the current practice is for economic factors to come in after SAGE has given its advice to Government. #coronavirusuk  Watch our session live here: https://t.co/KwPL2Fko0j"

1257593820004450304,2020-05-05 08:51:46,4,6,"Sir Patrick says that he is a strong advocate of transparency and openness, and as Chair of SAGE he has ensured papers from SAGE are published and will continue to do so as quickly as possible. He says: his focus is on giving Ministers advice and not making information  public https://t.co/kGJ4zQQQpv"
1257591254013161473,2020-05-05 08:41:34,1,3,"@uksciencechief Sir Patrick says: [...] inevitably we are learning as we go along, and as we learn we will become more informed about which decisions we should take"
1257590852874010625,2020-05-05 08:39:58,3,7,"He adds: the evidence  from around the world and the UK suggests that people get an antibody response post viral infection. But we don't know the degree of immune protection that this will provide, we don't know whether it provides absolute immunity or protection to other people"
1257590561982349314,2020-05-05 08:38:49,0,4,"Sir Patrick tells us that we will get better ideas of the replication rate of the virus by community testing. He says that there are essentially 3 rates of infection at the moment, in the community, in hospitals and in care homes."
